# Contributing to Awesome GitHub Copilot

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Awesome GitHub Copilot repository! We welcome contributions from the community to help expand our collection of custom instructions and prompts.

## How to Contribute

### Adding Instructions

Instructions help customize GitHub Copilot's behavior for specific technologies, coding practices, or domains.

1. **Create your instruction file**: Add a new `.md` file in the `instructions/` directory
2. **Follow the naming convention**: Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens (e.g., `python-django.instructions.md`)
3. **Structure your content**: Start with a clear heading and organize your instructions logically
4. **Test your instructions**: Make sure your instructions work well with GitHub Copilot

#### Example instruction format

```markdown
---
description: 'Instructions for customizing GitHub Copilot behavior for specific technologies and practices'
---

# Your Technology/Framework Name

## Instructions

- Provide clear, specific guidance for GitHub Copilot
- Include best practices and conventions
- Use bullet points for easy reading

## Additional Guidelines

- Any additional context or examples
```

### Adding Prompts

Prompts are ready-to-use templates for specific development scenarios and tasks.

1. **Create your prompt file**: Add a new `.prompt.md` file in the `prompts/` directory
2. **Follow the naming convention**: Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens and the `.prompt.md` extension (e.g., `react-component-generator.prompt.md`)
3. **Include frontmatter**: Add metadata at the top of your file (optional but recommended)
4. **Structure your prompt**: Provide clear context and specific instructions

#### Example prompt format

```markdown
---
agent: 'agent'
tools: ['codebase', 'terminalCommand']
description: 'Brief description of what this prompt does'
---

# Prompt Title

Your goal is to...

## Specific Instructions

- Clear, actionable instructions
- Include examples where helpful
```

### Adding an Agent

Agents are specialized configurations that transform GitHub Copilot Chat into domain-specific assistants or personas for particular development scenarios.

1. **Create your agent file**: Add a new `.agent.md` file in the `agents/` directory
2. **Follow the naming convention**: Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens and the `.agent.md` extension (e.g., `react-performance-expert.agent.md`)
3. **Include frontmatter**: Add metadata at the top of your file with required fields
4. **Define the persona**: Create a clear identity and expertise area for the agent
5. **Test your agent**: Ensure the agent provides helpful, accurate responses in its domain

#### Example agent format

```markdown
---
description: 'Brief description of the agent and its purpose'
model: 'gpt-5'
tools: ['codebase', 'terminalCommand']
name: 'My Agent Name'
---

You are an expert [domain/role] with deep knowledge in [specific areas].

## Your Expertise

- [Specific skill 1]
- [Specific skill 2]
- [Specific skill 3]

## Your Approach

- [How you help users]
- [Your communication style]
- [What you prioritize]

## Guidelines

- [Specific instructions for responses]
- [Constraints or limitations]
- [Best practices to follow]
```

### Adding Skills

Skills are self-contained folders in the `skills/` directory that include a `SKILL.md` file (with front matter) and optional bundled assets.

1. **Create a new skill folder**: Run `npm run skill:create -- --name <skill-name> --description "<skill description>"`
2. **Edit `SKILL.md`**: Ensure the `name` matches the folder name (lowercase with hyphens) and the `description` is clear and non-empty
3. **Add optional assets**: Keep bundled assets reasonably sized (under 5MB each) and reference them from `SKILL.md`
4. **Validate and update docs**: Run `npm run skill:validate` and then `npm run build` to update the generated README tables

### Adding Plugins

Plugins group related agents, commands (prompts), and skills around specific themes or workflows, making it easy for users to install comprehensive toolkits via GitHub Copilot CLI.

1. **Create your plugin**: Run `npm run plugin:create` to scaffold a new plugin
2. **Follow the naming convention**: Use descriptive, lowercase folder names with hyphens (e.g., `python-web-development`)
3. **Define your content**: List agents, commands, and skills in `plugin.json` using the Claude Code spec fields
4. **Test your plugin**: Run `npm run plugin:validate` to verify your plugin structure

#### Creating a plugin

```bash
npm run plugin:create -- --name my-plugin-id
```

#### Plugin structure

```
plugins/my-plugin-id/
├── .github/plugin/plugin.json  # Plugin metadata (Claude Code spec format)
└── README.md                   # Plugin documentation
```

> **Note:** Plugin content is defined declaratively in plugin.json using Claude Code spec fields (`agents`, `commands`, `skills`). Source files live in top-level directories and are materialized into plugins by CI.

#### plugin.json example

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin-id",
  "description": "Plugin description",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "keywords": [],
  "author": { "name": "Awesome Copilot Community" },
  "repository": "https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot",
  "license": "MIT",
  "agents": ["./agents/my-agent.md"],
  "commands": ["./commands/my-command.md"],
  "skills": ["./skills/my-skill/"]
}
```

#### Plugin Guidelines

- **Declarative content**: Plugin content is specified via `agents`, `commands`, and `skills` arrays in plugin.json — source files live in top-level directories and are materialized into plugins by CI
- **Valid references**: All paths referenced in plugin.json must point to existing source files in the repository
- **Instructions excluded**: Instructions are standalone resources and are not part of plugins
- **Clear purpose**: The plugin should solve a specific problem or workflow
- **Validate before submitting**: Run `npm run plugin:validate` to ensure your plugin is valid

### Adding Agentic Workflows

[Agentic Workflows](https://github.github.com/gh-aw) are AI-powered repository automations that run coding agents in GitHub Actions. Defined in markdown with natural language instructions, they enable scheduled and event-triggered automation with built-in guardrails.

1. **Create your workflow file**: Add a new `.md` file in the `workflows/` directory (e.g., `daily-issues-report.md`)
2. **Include frontmatter**: Add `name`, `description`, `triggers`, and optionally `tags` at the top, followed by agentic workflow frontmatter (`on`, `permissions`, `safe-outputs`) and natural language instructions
3. **Test locally**: Compile with `gh aw compile --validate` to verify it's valid
4. **Update the README**: Run `npm run build` to update the generated README tables

> **Note:** Only `.md` files are accepted — do not include compiled `.lock.yml` or `.yml` files. CI will block them.

#### Workflow file example

```markdown
---
name: 'Daily Issues Report'
description: 'Generates a daily summary of open issues and recent activity as a GitHub issue'
triggers: ['schedule']
tags: ['reporting', 'issues', 'automation']
on:
  schedule: daily on weekdays
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: read
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[daily-report] "
    labels: [report]
---

## Daily Issues Report

Create a daily summary of open issues for the team.

## What to Include

- New issues opened in the last 24 hours
- Issues closed or resolved
- Stale issues that need attention
```

#### Workflow Guidelines

- **Security first**: Use least-privilege permissions and safe outputs instead of direct write access
- **Clear instructions**: Write clear natural language instructions in the workflow body
- **Descriptive names**: Use lowercase filenames with hyphens (e.g., `daily-issues-report.md`)
- **Test locally**: Use `gh aw compile --validate` to verify your workflow compiles
- **No compiled files**: Only submit the `.md` source — `.lock.yml` and `.yml` files are not accepted
- Learn more at the [Agentic Workflows documentation](https://github.github.com/gh-aw)
